## Executive Summary/Abstract: 
Despite being one of the richest countries in the world, our country is severely lacking in human capital. Scoring at 0.53 and ranked 87 worldwide according to the Wall Street Journal, it reflects poorly on the development of our country. As such, we believe there is a great need for innovation to jump start our youth and restructure the way our education system works.
One of the main things our education system lacks is the support for non-academic activities. Many creative talents and youths are forced to sit through formal education that they have no talent nor interest in.
As such, our proposed solution is an attempt of gamification on soft skills and non-academic education. An app that can help others grow their non-academic skills such as art and other soft skills through competitions and events. It will also help the user build reputation, make a portfolio, as well as having a passion project to work on.
We believe that this project will help grow the untapped potential of our country’s youth. The potential that was shadowed by the current formal education system that does not cater to the creative talents and skills.



## How did your team come up with this project?
We came up with this project after realizing how hard the formal education system is to certain groups of youth. It does not cater well to individuals who have creative talent over cognitive talent and does not give equal opportunity to them. As such, we wish to create a digital alternative that can give anyone an opportunity to grow their creative talent by competing with other people and building their own experience.
